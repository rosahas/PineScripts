These are the PineScripts I have created or updated from publicly available information or existing scripts for my own usage. 

This script:  CoveredCallETF_MedianStrategy, is based on 
https://www.reddit.com/r/YieldMaxETFs/comments/1io6n1v/the_1b_covered_call_investment_strategy_updated/
It's built mainly using AI generated code and using some other snippets for labels etc.
